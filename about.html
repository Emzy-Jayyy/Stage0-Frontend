            <h2>Note to Future Self</h2>
            <p>Hey Emzy, remember how excited and nervous you felt starting this journey? Every expert
                was once a beginner. Embrace the challenges, celebrate the small wins, and never stop learning.
                The bugs you're struggling with today will become the solutions you teach others tomorrow.
                Stay curious, stay humble, and keep building.</p>

        <section data-testid="test-about-extra">
            <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
            <p> Beyond coding, I believe in the power of community and collaboration. The best developers
                aren't just great at writing codeâ€”they're great at communicating, teaching, and lifting
                others up. I'm excited to be part of this program not just to improve my technical skills,
                but to connect with fellow developers, share knowledge, and grow together.</p>
